# Timer App with Multiple Modes

Build a timer application that can function as a countdown timer, stopwatch, and interval timer.

**Features:**

- Use `useState` to manage the timer mode, time, and interval settings.
- Use `useEffect` to handle the timer logic based on the selected mode.
- Use `useRef` to store the timer interval ID.
- Create custom hooks `useCountdown`, `useStopwatch`, and `useIntervalTimer` to encapsulate the logic for each mode.

**Steps:**

1. Set up a basic interface to switch between countdown, stopwatch, and interval timer modes.
2. Use `useRef` to store the timer interval ID.
3. Create custom hooks `useCountdown`, `useStopwatch`, and `useIntervalTimer` for each timer mode.
4. Use `useEffect` to manage the timer logic and update the display based on the selected mode.

These projects will help you practice and deepen your understanding of `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and custom hooks.
